# MARTENSEED

## Seed for MEAN stack applications (in Coffeescript).

I'm leaving this pretty much undocumented ("it's self-documenting!"), but it automatically handles a lot of the stuff I need to get rolling with an Angular app that runs MongoDB, Node and Express on the back-end. It uses Coffeescript and Jade because I love syntactic sugar.
